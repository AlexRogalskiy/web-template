Place the database migration scripts in this directory. Try to keep the scripts fine grained per defined version
and only group changes related to the same table or to changes that belongs to the same logical functionality. 


The adopted naming convention is:

V<MAJOR>.<MINOR>__<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>.sql

<MAJOR> is the data-set version and we start from 1 in current version
<MINOR> is the sequential counter for each individual change belonging to this data-set


Example:

V1.1__ADD_NAV_GROUP_ID.sql


Baseline version is 1 so the first migration will have version V1.1
